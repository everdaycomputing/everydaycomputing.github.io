**Name**: Todd Lash

**LTEC Role**: Teacher Leader (former);  Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Illinois (current)

<!--excerpt-->

**Professional Background**: I am a former grade K-5 teacher of 17 years.  I have taught 2â€“5 grades as a classroom teacher, looped, been a school librarian, and instructional coach.  

**Why is LTEC my jam?** Part of what makes LTEC such a fantastic project is that I get work with and learn from an outstanding and varied group of professionals in a collaborative atmosphere.  The LTEC project is all about reciprocal learning between the various participants, including working teacher/practitioners, curriculum developers, computer scientists and researchers.  

**My work**: I love participating in data collection. Being in schools, seeing students computing and growing and getting excited is my thing. It energizes me and drives my thinking and writing.  

**What I do with my spare time**: I love to spend time with my son (9 y.o.), my wife, and my dog Marley. I also love to cook and I am continually finding new dishes to try or creating things on my own. I enjoy lifting weights, working outside, and tinkering with things I probably have no business tinkering with.

**Fun facts**:

* I was once kidnapped while in Jamaica.
* I survived a tornado hitting my house when I was 8.
* I have to have shots in my eyes regularly to keep me from going blind.
