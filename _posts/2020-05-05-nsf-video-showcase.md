Once again we are excited to participate in the 2020 NSF [STEM for All Video Showcase](https://stemforall2020.videohall.com) to Highlight Innovations in STEM Education!

## About the STEM for All Video Showcase

Now in its sixth year, the annual showcase will feature over 170 innovative projects aimed at improving STEM learning and teaching, which have been funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. During the week-long event, researchers, practitioners, policy makers and members of the public are invited to view the short videos, discuss them with the presenters online, and vote for their favorites.

The theme for this year’s event is “Learning from Research and Practice.” Video presentations address improving K-12 STEM classroom, informal environments, undergraduate and graduate education, teacher professional development, and community engagement. Collectively the presentations cover a broad range of topics including science, mathematics, computer science, engineering, cyberlearning, citizen science, maker spaces, broadening participation, research experiences, mentoring, professional development, NGSS and the Common Core.

The Learning Trajectories for Everyday Computing (LTEC) team has worked to iteratively develop and test integrated fractions + computational thinking lessons and assessments for grades 3 and 4. These instructional materials are aligned with learning trajectories in the areas of sequencing, repetition, conditional logic, decomposition, and debugging. In this year of the project, we are conducting a study to investigate the extent to which these integrated lessons influence students' understanding of mathematics as well as their computational thinking. 

We encourage everyone -- from researchers to policy-makers to teachers to interested community members -- to visit the video showcase, join the discussion, and vote for our video by sharing it on social media!
