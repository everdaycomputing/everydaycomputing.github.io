### Why is LTEC my jam? ###

With limited experience in CS education, LTEC gives me eye-opening opportunities. As a special educator, I enjoyed how students with disabilities engaged in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> content and developed social interaction with their peers.

### My work ###

On the team, I primarily support teachers for math and <abbr title="Computer Science/Computational Thinking">CS/CT</abbr> integrated lessons.

### What I do with my spare time ###

I try to read books and watch movies. I love to Crochet, making cat toys, bags, etc. I have two cats, Nabi (means Butterfly in Korean) and Ballee (Bees in Korean). I love to play with them.

### Fun facts ###

I love working out with my friends. We go for a run outside and to fitness classes. We sometimes make fun of each other.
