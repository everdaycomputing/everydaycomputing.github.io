Once again we are excited to participate in the 2019 NSF [STEM for All Video Showcase](https://stemforall2019.videohall.com) to Highlight Innovations in STEM Education!

## About the STEM for All Video Showcase

Each year, this showcase features innovative projects aimed at improving STEM learning and teaching, which have been funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. During the week-long event, researchers, practitioners, policy makers and members of the public are invited to view the short videos, discuss them with the presenters online, and vote for their favorites.

The theme for this year’s event is “Innovations in STEM Education.” Video presentations address improving K-12 STEM classroom, informal environments, undergraduate and graduate education, teacher professional development, and community engagement. Collectively the presentations cover a broad range of topics including science, mathematics, computer science, engineering, cyberlearning, citizen science, maker spaces, broadening participation, research experiences, mentoring, professional development, NGSS and the Common Core.

This year our video submission focused on our progression from developing Learning Trajectories (LTs) to using them to design a curriculum as a vehicle for research about integrating Math + <abbr title="Computational Thinking">CT</abbr> instruction. Action Fractions is a 3rd and 4th grade integrated curriculum that builds fractions knowledge and CS/CT skills through approximately 12 hours of instruction in each year. We describe our motivation, our curriculum, and how we will use the development and deployment of our curriculum to further research in Math + CT integration.

We encourage everyone -- from researchers to policy-makers to teachers to interested community members -- to visit the video showcase, join the discussion, and vote for our video by sharing it on social media!
