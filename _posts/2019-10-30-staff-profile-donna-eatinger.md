### Name ###

Donna Eatinger

### LTEC Role ###

School Development Specialist

### Professional Background ###

Before joining the staff at [UChicago STEM Education](http://stemed.uchicago.edu), I was an elementary school educator for 13 years. I taught first, second and third grade in both urban and suburban schools. I was a computer programmer, independent consultant and Microsoft trainer for several years prior to being an elementary educator.

### Why is LTEC my jam? ###

I am excited to work with LTEC because I get to use both of my skill sets to help students! I am amazed at the level of student engagement using computer science to help with math concepts. I taught [Everyday Mathematics](http://everydaymath.uchicago.edu) for nine years, so I am thrilled to be working with some of the outstanding authors of this curriculum!

### What I do with my spare time ###

I love to read, practice yoga, and run. I also love spending time with my husband, daughter, son and dog.

### Fun facts ###
* I went on a 10-day hiking trip in Greece. 
* I love spending time in Cape Coral, Florida.
* I meet with my teacher friend group every month to discuss books, movies, travel, food and teaching!
