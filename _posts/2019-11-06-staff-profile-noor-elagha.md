### Name ###

Noor Elagha

### LTEC Role ###

### Why is LTEC my jam? ###

Most of the reason I am pursuing higher education in this domain is to contribute to equity in education. Being part of the effort to provide equitable access to math + <abbr title="Computational Thinking">CT</abbr> knowledge and skills has already taught me so much, and I'm glad I get to be in the thick of it right from the beginning!

### My work ###

I contribute mostly to the <abbr title="Computational Thinking">CT</abbr> assessment design and validation process, response scoring, and data analysis.

### What I do with my spare time ###

I really like reading auto/biographies, and recounts of living through war crimes are my favorite (I have no idea why).

### Fun facts ###

I have a soft spot for skylines ;)
