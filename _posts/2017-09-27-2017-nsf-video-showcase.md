Earlier this summer the LTEC project participated in the [2017 NSF STEM for All Video Showcase](http://stemforall2017.videohall.com).  The showcase provides the opportunity for Federally funded projects to share their work in STEM and CS education.  In addition to displaying the videos, the initiative invites the community to engage with the presenters on each videos page.  

Please take a minute to catch up on what's been going on with LTEC.
