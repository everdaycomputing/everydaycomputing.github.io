**Name:** John Hampton

**LTEC Role:** Doctoral student (3rd) year in Educational Technology @ the University of Florida; graduate assistant. 


**Professional Background:** I taught high school English for 10 years, from remedial reading to college-level literature and linguistics. I also taught photojournalism for several years and was in charge of the yearbook program.

**Why is LTEC my jam?** As an ex-teacher, I love seeing how multiple, disparate subjects can be taught together for the benefit of students and teachers. In my own English classroom, I enjoyed combining art, cinema, history, and other mixed media into my curriculum. <abbr title="Learning Trajectories for Everyday Computing">LTEC</abbr> — with its goal of combining math and <abbr title="Computational Thinking">CT</abbr> skills — also fits with one of my research interests on how students identity is constructed through their schooling.

**My work:** On the <abbr title="Learning Trajectories for Everyday Computing">LTEC</abbr>, <abbr title="Creative Technology Research Lab">CTRL</abbr>, and <abbr title="Teaching All Computational Thinking through Inclusion and Collaboration">TACTIC</abbr> teams, I primarily help to develop teacher and student lessons for math and CT integration. I also help with the creative processes of movie-making and graphic design.

**What I do with my spare time:** I have a wife and two teenage children (14 and 17). I also have a small fur baby named Penny.

I enjoy reading fantasy novels, pondering the complex mysteries of the universe, and playing competitive tennis a few days a week.
