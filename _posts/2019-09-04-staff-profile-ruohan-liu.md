### Why is LTEC my jam? ###

Working with LTEC gives me great experience in learning new things and collaborating with people of different expertise, it helps me a lot in building up skills in communication, time management, project management, etc. LETC brings me the opportunity to work with and learn from the most supportive mentor and a group of the most excellent colleagues.

### My work ###

I help with <abbr title="Computational Thinking">CT</abbr> curriculum review and improvement, data collection and analysis, and make instructional videos on programming concepts. I also facilitate study implementation in local schools.

### What I do with my spare time ###

I love making different kinds of drinks (coffee, black/green milk tea, smoothies, Matcha drinks, etc.) for my family and friends. I also like baking, and cooking chinese food. My favourite way of spending spare time is lying in my papasan chair and enjoying a good movie :)

### Fun facts ###

* I was once bitten by a cat because I was accidentally stepping on her tail.
* It took me several years learning how to ride a bicycle.
* I crashed into a bush on the way to the road driving test, of course I didn’t get passed that time, LOL.
